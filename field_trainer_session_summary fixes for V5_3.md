# Field Trainer V5.3 Development Session Summary
**Date:** September 22, 2025  
**System:** Circuit training device management with 6 Raspberry Pi devices  
**Objective:** Resolve client connectivity and deployment issues

## Initial Problem
The Field Trainer Flask interface could detect all devices via BATMAN-adv mesh network but could not deploy courses. Course deployment required manually running `field_client_v5_2.py` on each device, indicating a disconnect between mesh discovery and TCP communication layers.

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed multiple interconnected issues:

1. **File Location Mismatch**: Client scripts were located in `/home/pi/` but the deployment system expected them in `/opt/field-trainer/app/`
2. **Process Management Issues**: Multiple conflicting client processes running simultaneously on devices
3. **Systemd Service Configuration**: Auto-starting services with incorrect node IDs (`192.168.99.10X` instead of device-specific IPs)
4. **Mesh Cell Fragmentation**: Devices creating separate mesh cells instead of joining unified network

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. File Structure Standardization
- **Problem**: Client scripts in wrong location, breaking deployment pipeline
- **Solution**: Moved `field_client_v5_2.py` from `/home/pi/` to `/opt/field-trainer/app/` on all devices
- **Impact**: Aligned client locations with VSCode deployment workflow for consistent updates

### 2. Process Cleanup and Management  
- **Problem**: Multiple duplicate client processes causing TCP connection conflicts
- **Solution**: Systematic cleanup using `pkill -9` and device reboots when processes wouldn't terminate
- **Result**: Achieved single client process per device

### 3. Systemd Service Configuration
- **Problem**: Services auto-starting with placeholder node ID `192.168.99.10X`
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed service files with device-specific node IDs (101, 102, 103, 104, 105)
  - Removed duplicate `field-client.service` from Devices 2 & 3
  - Configured services to run from correct directory `/opt/field-trainer/app/`
- **Configuration**:
  ```
  WorkingDirectory=/opt/field-trainer/app
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 field_client_v5_2.py --node-id 192.168.99.10[X]
  Restart=always
  ```

### 4. Mesh Network Status Assessment
- **Current State**: 3 separate mesh cells instead of unified network
  - Devices 1,3,4,5: Cell `AA:C1:B1:F5:38:2B`
  - Device 0: Cell `EA:08:AF:B8:82:38` 
  - Device 2: Cell `96:12:47:68:89:7E`
- **Impact**: Despite fragmentation, TCP communication works across cells
- **Decision**: Deferred mesh unification as current setup is functional

## Final System State
- **All 6 devices connected** and communicating properly
- **Flask interface shows all devices as ready** for course deployment
- **Systemd services properly configured** with unique node IDs per device
- **Auto-start on boot enabled** for persistent operation
- **File locations aligned** with deployment pipeline for consistent updates

## Key Technical Insights
1. **Mesh vs TCP Layers**: BATMAN-adv mesh discovery works independently of TCP client connections
2. **Systemd Persistence**: Service configuration changes require stop/reload/start cycle to take effect
3. **Process Conflicts**: Multiple clients on same device create connection competition and timeouts
4. **Deployment Alignment**: Client file locati
