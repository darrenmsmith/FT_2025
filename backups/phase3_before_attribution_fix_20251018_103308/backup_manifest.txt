Phase 3 Backup - Before Attribution Fix
Date: Sat 18 Oct 10:33:08 PDT 2025
Location: /opt/backups/phase3_before_attribution_fix_20251018_103308

Working:
- 3 athletes completing with 5 segments each (sequential)
- UNIQUE constraint preventing duplicates
- Solid LED (no audio popping)

About to fix:
- Touch attribution logic (handle skipped devices)
- Currently touch goes to wrong athlete when device skipped

Files backed up:
- coach_interface.py (contains find_athlete_for_touch)
- db_manager.py (contains segment marking)
- field_trainer.db (current state)
